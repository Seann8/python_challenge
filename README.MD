#Python Challenge Solutions


this repo contains solutions to the Python Challenge website. I'll add them as I solve them and I decided to write them in Python 3
for fun :P

I'll include notes as to how I solved the problems in the fiels themselves and this README , but I'd encourage people to look at the README first rather than jump straight to the solution.
